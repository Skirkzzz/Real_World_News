# Real World News

## A web page utilising API's in order to display what people are currently saying around the world.
Through a search bar users are able to choose a location and are shown it in google maps, alongside the latest posts from that locations subreddit. Thus creating an enviroment where the user is able to experience conversations and concerns of that location unfiltered by the media conglomerates of the 21st century.
